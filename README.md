### In this module:
I added a modal to highlight selected photos, and in doing so, you learned how to do the following:
- [x] Conditionally render a component.
- [x] Manage state between the parent and child components.
- [x] Toggle the state of the modal using a Hook.
- [x] Add tests for the modal.
- [x] Deploy to GitHub Pages.
--- 
- [x] Segmented UI into `Components` creating reusable functions
- [x] Managed `state` using `hooks`.
- [x] Used `JSX` as a shorthand approach to create elements.
- [x] `Conditionally rendered` of components and created a `single-page applications`.
